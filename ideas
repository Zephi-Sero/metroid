based on metroid nes, might include things from other games (i want arachnus)
text based obviously
needs saving, loading
kinda like homestuck??
missiles, super missiles, bombs, power bombs
health, energy tanks
goal is to defeat ridley and kraid, fight mother brain, escape zebeth
fighting other bosses you find along the way will give you access to powerful items (arachnus gives you spring ball..)
try to keep required items to a minimum (maru mari, missiles, bombs)
a lot of suits... (since this is text based i can just describe how my original suits look like i wont have to draw them)
